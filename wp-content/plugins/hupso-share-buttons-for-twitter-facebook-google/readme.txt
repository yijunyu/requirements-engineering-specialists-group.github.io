= How can I display share buttons only inside widget and not under posts? =

Add Hupso share buttons widget, then go to Hupso plugin settings and clear all fields in "Show buttons on" section.

= Can I set share buttons in such a way that it counts the entire site instead of just that specific page? =

Yes, you can. Enter your website root under "Custom url" in Settings. After that counters will show sharing stats for your whole website, not for each page individually.

= Buttons are not working properly. What can I do? =

Please upgrade the plugin to the latest version. If that does not help then try to reinstall the plugin (uninstall it and install it again).
If you still have problems then send bug report [using this feedback form](http://www.hupso.com/share/feedback/).

= Buttons are not working with one post. Only "Share" image in shown, but no social icons. They work correctly on other posts. What can I do? =

HTML of your post in not valid. You need to fix the text inside the post. Perhaps you forgot to close a p or div tag at the end. Perhaps you have some other HTML error in it. Use HTML validator if you cannot find an error.

= What settings are available? =

From Settings screen you are able to choose: button type (share button, share toolbar, counters), button size, social sharing services, menu type, button position (above or below your posts), display options.

Please look at *Screenshots* for more information.

= Are share buttons using Javascript? =

Yes. Javascript is required for sharing buttons to function properly and it must be enabled. Menu/toolbar/preview interface for share buttons is loaded at run-time from our servers so we can add minor enhancements and fix browser bugs the moment they are discovered without forcing you to upgrade the plugin all the time. Some button images are loaded from your local Wordpress installation and some from our servers. Counters load javascript code from Twitter, Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Pinterest or from other social services that are selected.

Yes. Thay are free and will always be free. And you do not need to open any account to use them.

[Hupso Share Buttons](http://www.hupso.com/share/) provide other button types including floating toolbars. We plan to implement those in next versions of this plugin.

= Why is featured post image not used as thumbnail with Facebook on new posts? =

You image should be at least 200px in both dimensions. This is a Facebook limitation. Please wait up to 24 hours for Facebook to fetch the new thumbnail. After that it should work.

= Found a bug? Have a suggestion? =

Please send bug reports and suggestion using [this feedback form](http://www.hupso.com/share/feedback/).
